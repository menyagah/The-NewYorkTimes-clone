                                <p class="par_1">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young<br> 
                                physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s<br> 
                                appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and<br> 
                                equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>

                                <p class="par_1">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic<br>
                                particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he <br>
                                discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. <br>
                                A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a<br>
                                 repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed <br>
                                 of light for a prodigiously violent instant.<br></p>


                                <p class="par_1">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the<br>
                                heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,<br>
                                 warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the<br>
                                wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but<br>
                                 would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>



                                <p class="par_1">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top<br>
                                of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>

                                <p class="par_1">On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers<br>
                                     reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that <br>
                                     his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

                                    Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though<br>
                                     many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be<br>

                                        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark<br>
                                        in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing<br>
                                        the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast<br>
